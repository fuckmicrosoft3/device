# IoT Device Management Service - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of three major features added to the IoT Device Management Service:

1. **Batch Device Registration**
2. **Granular OTA Update Endpoints**
3. **Batch OTA Update Management**

## Features Implemented

### 1. Batch Device Registration

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v2/devices/batch`

**Purpose:** Register multiple devices in a single API call with transactional integrity.

**Key Features:**

- Processes up to 100 devices per batch
- All-or-nothing transaction behavior for validation failures
- Partial success handling - returns both successful and failed registrations
- Organization validation and device limit enforcement
- Automatic device UID generation if not provided

**Request Format:**

```json
[
  {
    "device_uid": "device-001",
    "organization_id": 1,
    "serial_number": "SN001",
    "hardware_version": "v1.0"
  },
  {
    "device_uid": "device-002",
    "organization_id": 1,
    "serial_number": "SN002",
    "hardware_version": "v1.0"
  }
]
```

**Response Format:**

```json
{
  "successful": [
    {
      "device": {
        "id": 1,
        "device_uid": "device-001",
        "organization_id": 1,
        ...
      }
    }
  ],
  "failed": [
    {
      "device": {
        "device_uid": "device-002",
        "organization_id": 999
      },
      "error": "organization not found"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Granular OTA Update Endpoints

**New Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/v2/device/{uid}/updates/{session}/ack` - Device acknowledges update
- `POST /api/v2/device/{uid}/updates/{session}/flashed` - Device reports flash completion

**Purpose:** Provide more granular tracking of the OTA update process with additional status transitions.

**New Status Constants:**

- `UpdateStatusAcknowledged` - Device has acknowledged the update
- `UpdateStatusFlashed` - Firmware has been flashed successfully

**Enhanced Workflow:**

1. `InitiateUpdate` → `UpdateStatusInitiated`
2. Device calls `/ack` → `UpdateStatusAcknowledged`
3. Device downloads firmware → `UpdateStatusDownloading`
4. Device calls `/flashed` → `UpdateStatusFlashed` + updates device firmware version
5. Device calls `/complete` → `UpdateStatusCompleted`

**Key Features:**

- Status validation prevents invalid transitions
- `/flashed` endpoint automatically updates device's firmware version
- Transactional updates ensure data consistency

### 3. Batch OTA Update Management

**New Endpoints:**

- `POST /api/v2/updates/batches` - Create batch update job
- `GET /api/v2/updates/batches` - List all batch updates
- `GET /api/v2/updates/batches/{id}` - Get batch details with device status

**Purpose:** Create and manage OTA updates for multiple devices simultaneously.

**New Models:**

- `UpdateBatch` - Represents a batch update job
- `UpdateBatchDevice` - Tracks individual device status within a batch

**Batch Status Constants:**

- `BatchStatusPending` - Batch created, not yet processing
- `BatchStatusInProgress` - Batch is being processed
- `BatchStatusCompleted` - All devices processed
- `BatchStatusFailed` - Batch processing failed

**Device Status Constants:**

- `BatchDeviceStatusPending` - Device not yet processed
- `BatchDeviceStatusInitiated` - Update session created for device
- `BatchDeviceStatusSucceeded` - Device update completed successfully
- `BatchDeviceStatusFailed` - Device update failed

**Request Format:**

```json
{
  "name": "Production Rollout v2.1.0",
  "firmware_id": 5,
  "device_ids": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```

**Key Features:**

- Validates firmware exists and is approved
- Filters out inactive devices or devices with updates disabled
- Asynchronous background processing
- Up to 500 devices per batch
- Detailed per-device status tracking

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables

**update_batches:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE update_batches (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    firmware_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES firmware_releases(id),
    status VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

**update_batch_devices:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE update_batch_devices (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    update_batch_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES update_batches(id),
    device_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES devices(id),
    status VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    update_session_id VARCHAR REFERENCES update_sessions(session_id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

### Updated Models

**UpdateSession** - No schema changes, but new status values added
**Device** - No schema changes, but firmware_version updated by `/flashed` endpoint

## Implementation Status

✅ **Successfully Consolidated and Reorganized**

All batch update functionality has been successfully consolidated into the existing `UpdateManagementService`, and the entire `service.go` file has been **completely reorganized** for better maintainability.

### **Service Consolidation Benefits:**

- **Better Service Cohesion**: All OTA update functionality (individual and batch) is now in one service
- **Simplified Architecture**: No additional service dependencies or initialization required
- **Cleaner API**: All update-related endpoints use the same underlying service
- **Easier Maintenance**: Single service to maintain for all update operations

### **Service Organization Improvements:**

- **Sequential Service Structure**: All methods for each service are now grouped together
- **Clear Service Boundaries**: Easy to find and maintain methods for each service
- **Logical Flow**: Services organized in dependency order (Device → Telemetry → Firmware → Update → Organization → Authentication)
- **Improved Readability**: Each service's methods flow sequentially without interruption

**Key Consolidation and Reorganization Changes:**

- **Removed `UpdateBatchService` completely** - all functionality moved to `UpdateManagementService`
- **Reorganized entire `service.go`** with sequential method grouping by service
- **Added clear service section headers** with proper separation
- **Grouped supporting types** at the top of the file
- Updated handlers to use `updateManagement` service for all batch operations
- No changes needed to service registry (existing service expanded)
- All functionality tested and working correctly

### **New Service Organization:**

```
service.go Structure:
├── Shared Types and Structs
├── Device Management Service (all methods)
├── Telemetry Service (all methods)
├── Firmware Management Service (all methods)
├── Update Management Service (all methods including batch)
├── Organization Service (all methods)
└── Authentication Service (all methods)
```

## Migration Instructions

1. Run database migrations: `./device-service migrate`
2. Restart the service to load new endpoints
3. Update API documentation with new endpoints
4. Test batch operations in staging environment before production deployment

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with existing functionality while adding powerful new capabilities for managing IoT devices at scale. The reorganized service structure provides a clean, maintainable codebase that follows best practices for service organization and method grouping.
